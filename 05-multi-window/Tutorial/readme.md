# Multi Window Tutorial

The demo code loads up 3 social media sites.

The task for this tutorial is to make your own application with 3 or 4 websites you frequently visit.

## Not just a simple copy and paste

Have a look at the demo code and you will notice a couple of differences.
For example, the first frame loads in the top left of the window.

Another thing you may notice is how the initial file is loaded.

There is more than one way to achieve the same thing.
You could even ommit the start up window and load the websites from a menu.
